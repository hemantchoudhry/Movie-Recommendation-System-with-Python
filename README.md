# Movie-Recommendation-System-with-Python

## Welcome to the Movie Recommendation System project! In this project, we'll develop a basic recommender system using Python and pandas. The system will suggest movies based on their similarity to other movies in the dataset. While this is not a robust recommendation system, it serves as a starting point for understanding the concepts of recommendation systems and collaborative filtering.

# Project Overview

The objective of this project is to build a simple movie recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on the similarity between movies. We will leverage user ratings and movie metadata to calculate similarity scores and generate movie recommendations for users. This project is suitable for beginners who want to learn about recommendation systems and start experimenting with collaborative filtering techniques.

# Features

Collaborative Filtering: Use user ratings and movie metadata to calculate similarity scores between movies.
Movie Recommendations: Generate movie recommendations for users based on their preferences and similarity to other movies.
Python Implementation: Develop the recommendation system using Python programming language and pandas library.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Optionally, perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the movie dataset.
Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the recommendation system using metrics such as precision, recall, and mean squared error.

# Getting Started

# Prerequisites
Install Python and required libraries such as pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn.
Download the movie dataset or access it through a provided platform.

# Installation

## Install dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
## Download the movie dataset or load it directly into your Python environment.

# Usage
## Open the Jupyter notebook or Python script containing the recommendation system code.
## Load the movie dataset and preprocess it as necessary for similarity calculation.
# Implement the recommendation system algorithm, considering user ratings and movie metadata.
Generate movie recommendations for users based on their preferences and similarity to other movies.
Optionally, evaluate the performance of the recommendation system using evaluation metrics and validation techniques.

# Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have any suggestions, improvements, or additional features to add to the recommendation system, feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue.
